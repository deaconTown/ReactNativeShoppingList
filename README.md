# ReactNativeShoppingList
React Native Practice

https://ionicframework.com/docs/v3/ionicons/

This application is a shopping list created with React Native. 
It subscribes to the TheMealDb api. 
Uses async axios to fetch data from api.

Functions include:
1. Create new shopping lists (items in lists are added 3 times for some reason; will look into this. Lists not saving DB).
2. Remove existing shopping lists.
3. Edit existing shopping lists (so far remove item from list).
4. Search/Generate a meal by: name; category - beef, fish; ingredients, etc (most of the free endpoints in TheMealDb).
5. Add generated meal ingredients to a new shopping list.
